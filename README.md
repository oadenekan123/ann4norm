# ann4brains

ann4brains implements filters for **adjacency matrices**, representing networks, that can be used within a deep neural network. These filters are designed specifically for brain networks (i.e. connectomes), but can be used with adjacency matrices representing networks of any kind. 

If your dataset is raw connectivity data (e.g., diffusion or functional MRI volumes), you will need to first extract brain networks (i.e., 2D adjacency matrices) from this data using other software (e.g., the Connectome Computation System, https://github.com/zuoxinian/CCS or the HCP Connectome Toolbox, http://www.humanconnectome.org/software/)

ann4brains is a Python wrapper for [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) that implements the Edge-to-Edge, and Edge-to-Node filters as described in:

## Hello World

Here's a fully working, minimal ["hello world" example](https://github.com/jeremykawahara/ann4brains/blob/master/examples/helloworld.py),

```python
import os, sys
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats.stats import pearsonr
import caffe
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), '..'))) # To import ann4brains.
from ann4brains.synthetic.injury import ConnectomeInjury
from ann4brains.nets import BrainNetCNN
np.random.seed(seed=333) # To reproduce results.

injury = ConnectomeInjury() # Generate train/test synthetic data.
x_train, y_train = injury.generate_injury()
x_test, y_test = injury.generate_injury()
x_valid, y_valid = injury.generate_injury()

hello_arch = [ # We specify the architecture like this.
    ['e2n', {'n_filters': 16,  # e2n layer with 16 filters.
             'kernel_h': x_train.shape[2], 
             'kernel_w': x_train.shape[3]}], # Same dimensions as spatial inputs.
    ['dropout', {'dropout_ratio': 0.5}], # Dropout at 0.5
    ['relu',    {'negative_slope': 0.33}], # For leaky-ReLU
    ['fc',      {'n_filters': 30}],  # Fully connected (n2g) layer with 30 filters.
    ['relu',    {'negative_slope': 0.33}],
    ['out',     {'n_filters': 1}]]  # Output layer with 1 nodes as output.

hello_net = BrainNetCNN('hello_world', hello_arch) # Create BrainNetCNN model
hello_net.fit(x_train, y_train[:,0], x_valid, y_valid[:,0]) # Train (regress only on class 0)
preds = hello_net.predict(x_test) # Predict labels of test data
print("Correlation:", pearsonr(preds, y_test[:,0])[0]) # ('Correlation:', 0.61187756)
```

## Installation

ann4brains uses the following dependencies:

- numpy
- scipy
- h5py
- matplotlib
- cPickle
- [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe)

*You must already have [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) and pycaffe working on your system*

i.e., in Python, you should be able to run,
```python
import caffe
```
without errors.

[comment]: # (To install ann4brains, download it, cd to the ann4brains root folder, and then run the install command:)

To use ann4brains, download it, and try to run the [helloworld](https://github.com/jeremykawahara/ann4brains/blob/master/examples/helloworld.py) example:

```
git clone https://github.com/jeremykawahara/ann4brains.git
cd ann4brains/examples
python helloworld.py
```

This example will create synthetic data, train a small neural network, and should output the correlation of:
```
('Correlation:', 0.61187756)
```

More examples are in this [extended notebook](https://github.com/jeremykawahara/ann4brains/blob/master/examples/brainnetcnn.ipynb).

[comment]: # (python setup.py install --user)

## Working directly with Caffe

If you prefer to work directly with [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) and not use this wrapper, you can modify the [example prototxt files](https://github.com/jeremykawahara/ann4brains/tree/master/examples/proto) that implement the E2E and E2N filters. Or view the [Python files](https://github.com/jeremykawahara/ann4brains/blob/master/ann4brains/layers.py) that generate the E2E and E2N layers.

## What are these filters?
I wrote a [short blog post informally describing these filters](https://kawahara.ca/convolutional-neural-networks-for-adjacency-matrices/) and this work, which you may find helpful. But here are the key ideas (in the form of a gif):
### Edge-to-Edge
![edge to edge filter](https://i2.wp.com/kawahara.ca/wp-content/uploads/edge-to-edge-filter.gif?w=600 "Edge-to-Edge")

(Left) The input. (Yellow cross) the filter. (Right) The output response.

The Edge-to-Edge filter computes a weighted response over neighbouring edges for a given edge.

### Edge-to-Node
![edge to node filter](https://i0.wp.com/kawahara.ca/wp-content/uploads/edge-to-node-filter.gif?w=600 "Edge to Node")

(Left) The input. (Yellow cross) the filter. (Right) The output response.

The Edge-to-Node filter computes a weighted response over neighbouring edges for a given node.
